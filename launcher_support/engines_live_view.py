"""AURUM — ENGINES LIVE cockpit view.

Hybrid master-detail UI for the EXECUTE → ENGINES LIVE entry.
Separates engines into three buckets by readiness:

    LIVE        — currently running live/demo/testnet/paper
    READY       — has a validated live runner (ENGINES[*].live_ready)
    RESEARCH    — backtest-only, not exposed for live execution

Pure helpers here are testable; Tkinter rendering is smoke-tested
via `python launcher.py` → EXECUTE → ENGINES LIVE.
